# To Do List App

I've only ever worked on a mature app professionally, so I'm honing my Android skills by creating a simple app from scratch.

Note to recruiters: This is a project I am prepared to discuss and explain in order to illustrate my knowledge and judgement as a developer. 
I did not use GitHub Copilot or any LLMs to generate code for this project. 
I occasionally used ChatGPT to ask general questions when searching the Android docs and developer forums did not yield a relevant answer.


## Feature Goals:

- [x] Users can add to do list items
- [x] Users can mark or unmark their to do list items as Done.
- [x] Done items have an animated transition to the Done list.
- [x] Done items have text crossed out.
- [x] Items can be deleted.
- [ ] List items persist across sessions via device storage.
- [x] Custom icon on splash screen
